The fact that [REDACTED].com deliver exactly the tyre you order online to your chosen fitting depot and it's always there for when you arrive for the fitting is great. In short, it all works without any fuss or issue. Plus importantly, the [REDACTED] prices have always been the most competitive (online or offline); with or without the fitting element.

Was offered appointments on the website from Thursday, so chose the following Friday morning. [REDACTED] came back to say the garage couldn't carry out the work then, and offered Saturday morning instead, which wasn't convenient. To save time, I rang and spoke to a very helpful lady who organised it for first thing on the following Wednesday.The fitting experience was superb. I arrived, handed over the keys, and just under an hour later, the job was completed and the keys were returned.I spoke with the receptionist about the fitting dates. She told me that the delay was due to [REDACTED] not being able to supply the tyres in time for the first date I chose.Perhaps [REDACTED] should offer more realistic appointment dates to allow enough time for the tyres to arrive at the fitting location.\",\n",
       " 'Website was easy and quick to use. Tyre specs listed along with grades for efficiency and fuel consumption along with noise of the tyre. A mobile tyre fitting option was also available which was perfect for my situation.',\n",

Actual fitting of the tyres were done straight away at the local Troy branch. [REDACTED] is a definite 5 stars for tyre fitting and price. A guaranteed high quality service. RECOMMENDED 100% and THANK YOU!',\n",

Having done it now ill always do it this way. [REDACTED] is really easy to use & you can see lots of different makes of tyres & most importantly reviews & ratings on each tyre. Once you've chosen what & how many you want it gives you fitting locations & time slots (fitting included in the price) so you choose your most convenient location & time for fitting. The tyres get delivered to your chosen location, you rock up at the allotted time, they get fitted, job done. Great price too.

I dropped off my car the following morning at around 7.45 am to be told the second tyre had not yet arrived. My appointment was not until 2.00 pm, but one of the reasons I dropped it off earlier was to ensure the message about needing at least one of them to be done had been relayed appropriately from your company. I was told this was done however was struggling to believe that after being told 2 days before that my tyre would be tracked to ensure it was delivered in the following day.

Clearly the system knew at the time of checkout that I had potentially the wrong tyres as I got an automated email from them only once I had placed an order!! Trapped why not ask at the time of checkout!!! Had to pay the extra money which then took the total price to more than other quotes I had received.Then onto the fitting. The garage is only a few mins from my house. Booked for 8am on a Saturday. Arrived 7:50am. It then took 1 hour 45 mins to fit 2 tyres. Not impressed. Then when I drove away after that long wait my car warned me that the pressure in the drivers rear tyre was too low. It had about 10 psi less than the rest! So either the garage did not put enough in or the tyre was leaking air. Went back to the garage to get it checked out. No leak just not enough air put in (very dangerous). Drove away a second time to see that this time the same tyre still did not have enough air in it to match the rest of the tyres. I ended up going to a petrol garage and fixing the issue myself with the air pump. Small point also was that my alloys and tyres were absolutely covered in the white tyre lub. You expect some but the alloy was smothered in it. So had to take the car to the cleaners also.So in summary questionable buying process and a terrible fitting experience.',\n",

       " '[REDACTED] OK McConechys not OK. Ordered up my new tyres from [REDACTED] online, good price and good prompt service from [REDACTED]. However, I made a massive mistake in choosing McConechy\\'s, Sighthill, Edinburgh as the nominated tyre fitters. It is clear that as a [REDACTED] customer and not an actual McConechy\\'s customer appearing at their workplace wanting your tyres fitted, you are in actual fact an annoyance to them and you are getting in their way.McConechy\\'s fitted my tyres (although I\\'m very sure reluctantly).Upon being told by the tyre fitter that my car was now ready to go, I walked up to the car and noticed that there was no dustcaps fitted and had to request that 2 new dustcaps be fitted. I then left after being handed my tyre fitting paperwork.A day later I was checking the air pressures of my new tyres and then also noticed that McConechy\\'s had not even changed the valve stems either. I contacted McConechy\\'s about this and it was the tyre fitter that done the work that answered the phone. I told him that I noticed they had not changed the valve stems. I got this pathetic excuse about my existing valve stems being metal ones and he did not think I would have wanted rubber valve stems fitted, so he did not bother to change them and as an afterthought he stated \"but I changed the valve cores though\".I don\\'t believe a word of that, what the tyre fitter guy doesn\\'t know, is that I\\'m a fully qualified engineer and I know corner cutting when I see it. Remember I had to actually request that they fit dustcaps. Unfortunately I didn\\'t notice McConechy\\'s had not changed the valve stems at that time or I would have pulled them up right there and then.I know why he didn\\'t change the valve stems, it is because they are all rusted up, badly corroded and might take a bit longer to remove and change over, maybe even some other problems that\\'s why they were not changed and not his BS story about them being metal.I paid for 2 new tyres fitted and balanced with new valve stems and new valves fitted. That is not what I got.I got 2 new tyres fitted and balanced without new valve stems and a story that I don\\'t believe about the valve cores being changed.But that makes it OK doesn\\'t it ? NO, it certainly doesn\\'t !I was also supposed to have a free wheel alignment check done, the McConechy\\'s fitter never made any mention of this. I had already decided not to go ahead with the alignment check anyway.Also states on the tyre fitting paperwork that the wheel nuts were torqued to 110nm. Well when I checked them 50 miles later, the wheel nuts were all at very different torque levels, the locking wheel nuts being the tightest by far.I do not believe for 1 second that the wheels were even torqued in the first place, more like slammed back on and racked up with the air gun. There is no way the wheel nuts seen a torque wrench. The McConechy\\'s tyre fitter was/is a story telling corner cutter. Avoid them, you are not a McConechy\\'s customer, you are an annoyance to them, you are getting in their way. Not at all happy with any of this.Steven Dryden.',\n",
